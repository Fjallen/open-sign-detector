# open-sign-detector
Open-source project to detect traffic signs and classify them

# Built for the IARRC's challenge

Need to recognize signs? Train your own network! Because raw OpenCV is hard.

# The Dataset

The dataset consists of images broken from videos I took myself of the sign in different positions. I split up the images into folders so you can load them individually

# Built during this stream
