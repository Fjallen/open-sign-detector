# open-sign-detector
Open-source project to detect traffic signs and classify them

# Built for the IARRC's challenge

Need to recognize signs? Train your own network! Because raw OpenCV is hard.

# The Dataset

The dataset consists of images broken from videos I took myself of the sign in different positions. I split up the images into folders so you can load them individually


# The Model

The model is exported as the md5 file in the repos but feel free to build your own using the Jupyter Notebook provided.


# Built during this stream

And was completed in about an hour.

# Next steps:

1. Add more images
2. Add more augmentations to create a more general model, currently the model is already operating well in 2 epochs.
